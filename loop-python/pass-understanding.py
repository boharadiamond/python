'''
What this script does:
Defines a Student class using pass — no functionality yet.

Defines a process_data function as a placeholder — ready to be implemented.

Implements a function check_number(x):

Uses pass for positive numbers (left for later).

Prints output for zero and negative numbers.

Loops through numbers 0–4:

Skips even numbers using pass.

Prints odd numbers.

Asks the user to input a number, and check_number() processes it.


Expected Output:
If you run the script and enter -3, it will show:
Odd number: 1
Odd number: 3
Negative number detected.
